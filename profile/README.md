Here's a breakdown of what the games typically involve:

## Core Gameplay:
The main objective is to click or tap on the Labubu character to earn coins or points. These points are then used to buy upgrades, unlock new characters, and increase your income, often passively (even when you're not actively clicking).

## Collection & Progression:
As you play, you can unlock a variety of different Labubu figures, including rare, golden, or animated ones. The goal is to collect all the figures and complete your collection, which is often displayed on a virtual "toy shelf."

## Upgrades:
To increase your efficiency, you can purchase upgrades. These can include things that boost the coins you get per click or provide a passive income stream.

## Game Variations:
While the basic concept is the same, there are different versions of the Labubu Clicker game. Some are available as mobile apps on platforms like Google Play, while others are browser-based games. There's also a "merge" style version called "Labubu Merge Clicker," where you drop Labubu characters into a box and merge identical ones to create new, rarer forms, similar to games like "Suika Game" or "2048."

In essence, Labubu Clicker games are simple, casual, and addictive games designed for relaxation and the satisfying loop of earning, upgrading, and collecting.
